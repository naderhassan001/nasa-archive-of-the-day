<h1 align="center">NASA's Photo of The Day</h1>

<p align="center">
This program grabs a call from the NASA servers. It makes an API call and prints it out to a <div>. All you have to do is type in the date as the format in the placeholder, and click search. This will print out an image from NASA's archive.
